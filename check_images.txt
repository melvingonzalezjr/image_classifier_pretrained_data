Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Going just off of the four uploaded images, VGG and Resnet did the best job by correctly classifying all four images. However, I would probably be more inclined to use VGG as I know that won classifies the images in pet_images directory with the best accuracy.
